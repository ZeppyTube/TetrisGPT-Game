# TetrisGPT-Game
 Wanted to make tetris using ChatGPT so I did that too, came out pretty good !!DISCLAIMER!! MOST OF THIS CODE (99% OF IT) WAS MADE USING CHATGPT, I (ZEPPYTUBE) ONLY FIXED SOME OF IT. I AM NOT A CODER.

 How to run: 
 Install `pygame`, and then run `tetris.py`, it's as simple as that
